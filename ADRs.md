ADR (Architecture Detail Records):
- we rejected g.gravizo visualizer because of its undocumented and somehow non-standard syntax 
and opaque error messages : shame
- could not get elk to work in local so gave that up for the sake of my sanity (java config 
problems?)
- chose cytoscape/dagre with tool inspired by xstate prealpha visualizer
